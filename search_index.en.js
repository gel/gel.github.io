everything related to productivity given inputs such as free-text or code.\nThe new image or multi-modal based foundation models has made tremendous improvements and I wanted to explore them.\nMy goal was generating superheroes portraits using a ChatGPT Pro subscription (Dall-E is included).\nGenerating Superheroes Portraits with ChatGPT (Dall-E)\nChatGPT (Dall-E) will let you draw abstract superheroes but it is currently not possible to generate them from real people photos.\nThe generic response Dall-E will output is: \"I'm sorry, but I'm unable to use real individuals' faces from images to create new images. If you have any other requests or need assistance with something else, feel free to ask!\" \nTherefore, we will leverage Dall-E just to generate a generic face superhero (cartoonish or real) and later on replace it using a different product.\nMy project was generating a superhero named \"דני כוסברו\" which is a humorous word-play for a famous news broadcaster named \"Dani Kushmaro\" and Cilantro.\nIn order to generate a portrait I've uploaded the portrait of the reporter and asked ChatGPT:\n\"Draw a real person face that has coriander. The person should look like a superhero\"\nThis is the output image I got:\n\nAs you can see this is a great representation for a first try but the biggest problem that I've learnt later is that the coriander on the face makes it very difficult for the face-swap tool later.\nIn order to fix it, I've asked ChatGPT to fix it by writing:\n\"Draw a portrait of a person with their face merged with coriander, make sure the face is not too hidden so it can be easily replaced with a real person\"\nOutput image came exactly as I wanted it to be:\n\nLet's move to the second part of replacing it with the reporter real face.\nFace Swap - Simple (picsi.ai)\nInsightFace is an open source 2D&amp;3D deep face analysis library with more than 15k stars on github.\nThe product that is built on top of this library and more features is called picsi.ai and it is possible to set up a discord bot for free with 50 credits to leverage the face-swap functionality.\nThis is the swapping_discord github link but the process is super simple so I will describe it here.\nStep-by-step guide:\n\n\nRefer to this link to register Discord app, create a new chat room, and invite the Midjourney bot to the chat room.\n\n\nInvite the InsightFaceSwap bot to the chat room by this link: Discord Invite Link.\n\n\nUse /saveid command to register your person id with image/features.\n\n\nUse /swapid command to swap the input image with a given saved ID.\n\n\nThe final photos for the superhero are:\n\n\nFace Swap - Open-source (Offline)\nAny library / github project which is wrapping up Insightface is a good option.\nI've personally used the swapseed to do the replacement on my computer.\nThis is a sample code to run after installing the dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt\nimport os\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport gdown\nimport insightface\nfrom insightface.app import FaceAnalysis\nfrom insightface.data import get_image as ins_get_image\nfrom faceswap import swap_n_show, swap_n_show_same_img, swap_face_single,fine_face_swap\n\napp = FaceAnalysis(name='buffalo_l')\napp.prepare(ctx_id=0, det_size=(640, 640))\n\n# Download 'inswapper_128.onnx' file using gdown\nmodel_url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HvZ4MAtzlY74Dk4ASGIS9L6Rg5oZdqvu'\nmodel_output_path = 'inswapper/inswapper_128.onnx'\nif not os.path.exists(model_output_path):\n    gdown.download(model_url, model_output_path, quiet=False)\n\nswapper = insightface.model_zoo.get_model('inswapper/inswapper_128.onnx', download=False, download_zip=False)\n\n# Load images\nimg1_fn = 'input_and_output.png'\nimg2_fn = 'face_to_replace_from.jpg'\n\n# Swap faces between two images\n# swap_n_show(img1_fn, img2_fn, app, swapper)\n\n# Add face to an image\nswap_face_single(img1_fn, img2_fn, app, swapper, enhance=True, enhancer='REAL-ESRGAN 2x')\n\n","id":"https://gel.github.io/blog/dalle-faceswap/","title":"GenAI Real Face Superhero"},"https://gel.github.io/blog/wsl-environment/":{"body":"After many years of waiting patiently there is finally a reasonable way to have a unified development environment from windows named WSL version 2.

The book exposes the growing power of messianic and racist forces in Israel and their destructive influence on the management of the war we are in, as well as the threat they pose to Israeli democracy.\n\"Israel or Judah\" is a call to action and deep understanding of the processes unfolding in the country and identifying the dangers lurking if steps are not taken to protect its democratic values. The book reminds us of the importance of standing firm and collective mobilization, which alone can defeat the destructive forces from within.\nSefi Rachlevsky is a well-known and respected researcher, author, and publicist who has long acted as a sharp critic of anti-democratic trends in Israel.

It teaches that settling for mediocrity or mistreatment is not a virtue, but rather a disservice to oneself and others.\n\n\nTake Control: One of the most valuable lessons is about taking responsibility for one's own life and happiness. Instead of blaming external circumstances or other people, the book guides readers to recognize their own power in shaping their reality.\n\n\nEmbrace Vulnerability: Contrary to the \"nice guy\" facade of always being agreeable and perfect, the book advocates for embracing one's authentic self, including vulnerabilities. This authenticity leads to more meaningful connections and personal growth.\n\n\nSet Healthy Boundaries: The book provides practical guidance on establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries, which is crucial for both personal well-being and successful relationships.\n\n\nThe importance of this messaging cannot be overstated. In a world where many people struggle with people-pleasing tendencies and fear of conflict, this book serves as a wake-up call to live more authentically and assertively. It's particularly relevant in today's society where traditional notions of masculinity are being redefined, and men are seeking healthier ways to express themselves and build relationships.\nThe book's practical exercises and real-life examples make the concepts accessible and actionable. While some of the ideas might be challenging to implement initially, the long-term benefits of embracing these principles are well worth the effort.\nRating: 4.5/5 stars - A must-read for anyone looking to break free from people-pleasing patterns and build more authentic, fulfilling relationships. \n","id":"https://gel.github.io/books/personal-development/no-more-mr-nice-guy/","title":"No More Mr. Nice Guy"},"https://gel.github.io/books/personal-development/smarter-faster-better/":{"body":"","id":"https://gel.github.io/books/personal-development/smarter-faster-better/","title":"Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business @ Charles Duhigg"},"https://gel.github.io/books/personal-development/surrounded-by-idiots/":{"body":"","id":"https://gel.github.io/books/personal-development/surrounded-by-idiots/","title":"Surrounded by Idiots @ Thomas Erikson"},"https://gel.github.io/books/personal-development/the-7-habits/":{"body":"","id":"https://gel.github.io/books/personal-development/the-7-habits/","title":"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change @ Author Covey, Stephen R."},"https://gel.github.io/books/personal-development/the-innovation-stack/":{"body":"","id":"https://gel.github.io/books/personal-development/the-innovation-stack/","title":"The Innovation Stack: Building an Unbeatable Business One Crazy Idea at a Time @ Jim McKelvey"},"https://gel.github.io/books/personal-development/the-subtle-art/":{"body":"","id":"https://gel.github.io/books/personal-development/the-subtle-art/","title":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life @ Mark Manson"},"https://gel.github.io/books/programming/":{"body":"","id":"https://gel.github.io/books/programming/","title":""},"https://gel.github.io/books/programming/implementing-domain-driven-design/":{"body":"Warning: this is a very hard read, personally I feel this book is not written in a concise and organized form.\nI think the original intention is good of showing a bad software design choices and then how to fix them, but it definitely didn't transfer properly as a long software reading book.\nNonetheless, this book did change a lot of misconceptions I had in regards to architecture and tactical programming. \nIf you like to suffer and learn (like me) I still advise you to take the challenge!

We show that during Iterative DPO training that not only does instruction following ability improve, but also the ability to provide high-quality rewards to itself.\n\nOur approach first assumes access to a base pretrained language model, and a small amount of human-annotated seed data. We then build a model that aims to possess two skills simultaneously: 1. Instruction following: given a prompt that describes a user request, the ability to generate a high quality, helpful (and harmless) response. 2. Self-Instruction creation: the ability to generate and evaluate new instruction following examples to add to its own training set.\nWhile we report the results of both approaches in our experiments, we find that learning from preference pairs gives superior performance, and hence recommend that approach.\n\nIterative Training Our overall procedure trains a series of models M1, . . . , MT where each successive model t uses augmented training data created by the t − 1 th model. We thus define AIFT(Mt) to mean AI Feedback Training data created using model Mt. Model Sequence We thus define the models, and the training data they use as follows: M0 : Base pretrained LLM with no fine-tuning. M1 : Initialized with M0, then fine-tuned on the IFT+EFT seed data using SFT. M2 : Initialized with M1, then trained with AIFT(M1) data using DPO. M3 : Initialized with M2, then trained with AIFT(M2) data using DPO.\n\n[In-Context Pretraining] Language Modeling Beyond Document Boundaries🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10638 30 Nov 2023 Meta\nWe instead present IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING, a new approach where language models are pretrained on a sequence of related documents, thereby explicitly encouraging them to read and reason across document boundaries.\nIN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING instead reorders the pretraining data by combining several semantically related documents to create a coherent input context, thereby exposing LMs to long relevant contexts and providing pretraining signals beyond document boundaries.\nHowever, this document sorting problem is challenging. LMs are typically trained on billions of\ndocuments and we would like to sort them to maximize document similarity in the input context\nwindows without repeating any data. We introduce two new approximate algorithms to tackle these challenges.\n\nTechniques are using embedding models and top-k similarity search and leveraging approximate solutions for the traveling salesman problem - by the means of visiting every document once.\n[DPO] Direct Preference Optimization: Your LM is Secretly a Reward Model🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290 13 Dec 2023 Stanford\nIn this paper we introduce a new parameterization of the reward model in RLHF that enables extraction of the corresponding optimal policy in closed form, allowing us to solve the standard RLHF problem with only a simple classification loss. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant, and computationally lightweight,\neliminating the need for sampling from the LM during fine-tuning or performing significant hyperparameter tuning.\n\nDPO gradient for loss increases the likelihood of preferred completion (Y_W) and decreases the likelihood for dispreferred completion (Y_L). Importantly, the examples are weighed by how much higher the implicit reward model rˆθ rates the dispreferred completions, scaled by β, i.e, how incorrectly the implicit reward model orders the completions, accounting for the strength of the KL constraint. \nDPO outline. The general DPO pipeline is as follows: 1) Sample completions y1, y2 ∼ πref(· | x) for every prompt x, label with human preferences to construct the offline dataset of preferences D = {x (i) , y (i) w , yl) (i)} N i=1 and 2) optimize the language model πθ to minimize LDPO for the given πref and D and desired β. \n[RLHF] Secrets of RLHF in LLMs Part II: Reward Modeling🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15503 24 Dec 2023 Fudan NLP\nIn conclusion, while RLHF is a significant advancement in AI development, particularly in integrating human preferences into the learning process, it also presents unique challenges. These include the inherent noise and ambiguity in human feedback, potential biases in the data, and the generalization limits of reward models trained on specific datasets. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the advancement and ethical application of RLHF in AI systems.\n\nTo enhance the generalization ability of the reward model, we explore contrastive learning and\nmeta-learning. By introducing unsupervised contrastive loss during the reward modeling process, the reward model can better distinguish subtle preference differences among responses. To bridge the gap between the preference data distribution and the model output distribution, we employ meta-learning to ensure that the reward model not only performs well on the preference data but also can distinguish the differences in target domain outputs.\nTechnique is to randomize training data and do a k-fold split, build K models and then measure mean and deviations - negative mean is usually the mistakes. \nAccording to the results, we can observe that: 1) For the top 20% of data with the lowest preference strength, they have a negative impact on the model's performance on the validation set. The preference strength for these data subsets is less than 0. 2) For data ranked between 20% and 40%, after training, the model's prediction accuracy on the validation set is approximately 0.5. The preference strength for this type of data is around 0. 3) The remaining data significantly improves the model's performance. However, the top 10% of data with the highest preference strength does not achieve the best performance when trained alone. Based on the above results, we can roughly categorize preference data into three types: incorrect data, ambiguous data (almost no difference), and normal data (clear differences). These three types of preference data play different roles and make different contributions to preference modeling. It is necessary for us to conduct a more detailed analysis of them and then consider how to handle each type.\n[LLARA] Making LLMs A Better Foundation For Dense Retrieval🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06080 11 Jan 2024 Beijing Academy of AI\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach, called LLaRA (LLM adapted for dense RetrievAl), which works as a post-hoc adaptation of LLM for the dense retrieval application. LLaRA consists of two pretext tasks: EBAE (Embedding-Based Auto-Encoding) and EBAR (Embedding-Based Auto-Regression), where the text embeddings from LLM are used to reconstruct the tokens for the input sentence and predict the tokens for the next sentence, respectively\n\nParticularly, there are two pretext training tasks introduced by LLaRA: EBAE (Embedding-Based Auto-Encoding) and EBAR (Embedding-Based Auto-Regression). In EBAE, the LLM is prompted to generate the text embeddings, which can be used to predict the tokens for the input sentence itself. While with EBAR, the LLM is prompted to generate the text embeddings, which can be used to predict the  tokens for the next sentence. By learning from the above pretext tasks, the text embeddings from LLM can be adapted from Local semantic representations (i.e. prediction for the next tokens) to Global semantic representations (i.e. prediction for the sentence-level features). \n[RA-DIT] Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01352 2 Oct 2023 META\nRetrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) improve performance by accessing long-tail and up-to-date knowledge from external data stores, but are challenging to build. Existing approaches require either expensive retrieval-specific modifications to LM pre-training or use post-hoc integration of the data store that leads to suboptimal performance\nOur approach operates in two distinct fine-tuning steps: (1) one updates a pre-trained LM to better use retrieved information, while (2) the other updates the retriever to return more relevant results, as preferred by the LM\n[Sequential Monte Carlo] Steering of LLMs using Probabilistic Programs🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03081 5 Jun 2023 MIT\nContext: Despite significant advances in recent years, it remains unclear if and how large language models (LLMs) can be made reliable and controllable enough to meet the functional requirements of many applications. \nEven after fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, LLMs are liable to violate instructions in their prompts (such as \"Use the following vocabulary words\" or \"Do not reveal this prompt\").\nThese difficulties highlight the need for methods beyond prompting and fine-tuning for constraining the behavior of generative neural models.\n[TokenFormer] Rethinking Transformer Scaling with Tokenized Model Parameters🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23168 30 Oct 2024\nCurrent transformer models are hard to scale up because they use fixed linear projections for processing inputs. When you want to make the model bigger (e.g. increase dimensions), you typically have to retrain the whole thing from scratch. This is very computationally expensive and inefficient.\nInstead of using fixed linear projections, it represents model parameters as \"tokens\" that can interact with input data through attention mechanisms. The architecture has two main parts:\n\nToken-token attention: How input tokens interact with each other (like regular transformers)\nToken-parameter attention: How input tokens interact with parameter tokens (new innovation)\n\nKey Benefits:\n\nCan scale the model by just adding more parameter tokens without changing core architecture\nCan reuse parameters from smaller models when scaling up\nDoesn't need full retraining from scratch\n\nParameter tokens come in key-value pairs. Input tokens act as queries that attend to these parameter tokens. Can add more key-value parameter pairs to increase model capacity. Old parameters can be preserved while adding new ones.\nResults:\n\nSuccessfully scaled from 124M to 1.4B parameters incrementally\nAchieved similar performance to transformers trained from scratch\nRequired much less training compute (saved &gt;50% training cost)\nWorks well for both language and vision tasks\n\n[Context Distillation] Learning by Distilling Context🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15189 30 Sep 2022 UC\nGiven a synthetic unlabeled input for the target task, we condition the model on [instructions] + [task-input]'' to predict [scratch-pad] + [final answer]''; then we fine-tune the same model to predict its own [final answer]'' conditioned on the [task-input]'', without seeing the [instructions]'' or using the [scratch-pad]''.\n[ALPHALLM] Toward Self-Improvement of LLMs via Imagination, Searching, and Criticizing🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12253 18 Apr 2024\nALPHALLM is an imagination-searching-criticizing framework designed for the self-improvement of LLMs without the necessity of additional annotations. At its heart is the integration of MCTS with LLMs. To tackle the inherent challenges associated with this integration, including data scarcity, the vastness of search spaces, and the subjective nature of feedback in language tasks, it introduces:\n\nA data synthesizer for strategic prompt synthesis\nAn optimized MCTS tailored for efficient search in language tasks\nA trio of critic models to provide precise feedback\n\nExperimental findings on mathematical reasoning tasks reveal that ALPHALLM significantly boosts the performance of LLMs without requiring extra data annotations. Moreover, when decoded with ηMCTS, ALPHALLM performs comparably to GPT-4, highlighting the potential for self-improvement in LLMs.\n[Multi-Token Prediction] Better &amp; Faster LLMs via Multi-token Prediction🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19737 30 Apr 2024 Meta AI\nTraining language models to predict multiple future tokens at once results in higher sample efficiency. A key fix for memory problems is to not materialize all logits and keep shared trunk and sequential pass on heads.\n[Quiet-STaR] LMs Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09629 14 Mar 2024 Stanford\nQuiet-STaR is a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. Instead of thinking only at specific points, Quiet-STaR allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful.\n[GaLore] Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03507 6 Mar 2024\nGradient Low-Rank Projection (GaLore) is a training strategy that allows full-parameter learning but is more memory-efficient than common low-rank adaptation methods like LoRA. GaLore is closely related to projected gradient descent (PGD), but with key differences:\n\nGaLore considers the specific gradient form that naturally appears in training multi-layer neural networks\nTraditional PGD mostly treats the objective as a general blackbox nonlinear function\nSince the gradient G may have a low-rank structure, GaLore keeps the gradient statistics of a small \"core\" of gradient G in optimizer states\n\nFor complex optimization problems like LLM pretraining, it may be difficult to capture the entire gradient trajectory with a single low-rank subspace. GaLore addresses this by allowing switching across low-rank subspaces: Wt = W0 + ∆WT1 + ∆WT2 + ... + ∆WTn, where the switching frequency T becomes a hyperparameter.\n","id":"https://gel.github.io/generative-ai/2-llm-research/1-llm-pretraining-finetuning/","title":"LLM Pretraining & Fine-tuning"},"https://gel.github.io/generative-ai/2-llm-research/2-llm-agents/":{"body":"[AutoGen] Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Chat🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155 3 Oct 2023 Microsoft\nAutoGen is an open-source framework that allows developers to build LLM applications via multiple agents that can converse with each other to accomplish tasks.

Scaling AI models to superhuman levels requires that AI judges evolve accordingly to accurately evaluate these increasingly complex responses.\nIs verifying a problem's solution easier than solving the problem itself? Intuitively, verification should be simpler, as the model is provided with candidate solutions and only needs to identify the correct one, a task that would yield 50% accuracy through random guessing alone. Our results show that for a fixed model, the judge's accuracy closely mirrors that of the solver. While GPT-4o's and Gemini-1.5-Pro's judges slightly outperform their corresponding solvers, Claude-3.5-Sonnet's and Llama-3.1-405BInstruct's judges lag behind their respective solvers. Although the overall accuracy between the solver and judge is close, we observe a notable discrepancy in the Coding category, where the solver consistently outperforms the judge across all models. Conversely, in the Math category, judges significantly outperform solvers. This suggests that coding problems are more difficult to evaluate, while logical errors in math problems are generally easier to identify.\n[Prometheus 2] An OS LM Specialized in Evaluating Other LMs🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01535 2 May 2024\nWe introduce PROMETHEUS 2 (7B &amp; 8x7B), state-of-the-art open evaluator LMs that score high correlations with both human evaluators and proprietary LM-based judges on both direct assessment and pairwise ranking.\nTraining Approaches:\n\nSingle-Format Training: Training a base model on either direct assessment feedback dataset or pairwise ranking feedback dataset\nJoint Training: Training a base model on both direct assessment and pairwise ranking feedback datasets\nWeight Merging: Training two models separately and merging them with linear combination: θfinal = α × θd + (1 − α) × θp\n\n[PretrainingLoss] Understanding Emergent Abilities of LMs from the Loss Perspective🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15796 30 Mar 2024 Zhipu AI\nOur paper proposes a new definition of emergent abilities of language models from the perspective of pre-training loss.

Our approach, coined DPOK, integrates policy optimization with KL regularization.\nGeneration of more data includes generating n-1 negative samples and leveraging contrastive loss and generating more images to increase diversity.\nIn fine-tuning the loss function will be the expectancy of the sum of all the binary-human-classified dataset and also loss from the pre-training based data (weighted with B) to maintain accuracy of the model (avoid catastrophic forgetting). For the reward loss the idea is for the reward to be log-likelihood but it’s not easy, Therefore we minimize reward-weighted MSE loss instead.\nSetup: Pretrained Stable Diffusion 1.5, fine-tuning using static CLIP language encoder, Reward model is MLP using ViT-L/14 CLIP for image/text embeddings, Dataset 2700 prompts, 27k images, 16k unlabeled and 625k for pretraining.\nSFT: model is updated on a fixed dataset generated by the pre-trained model.\nRL: model is updated using new samples from the previously trained model during online RL fine-tuning.\nBased on the results, adding KL regularization helps in improving both image fidelity and accuracy (mostly image fidelty).\n[Point-E] A System for Generating 3D Point Clouds from Complex Prompts🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08751 16 Dec 2022 OpenAI\nIn this paper, we explore an alternative method for 3D object generation which produces 3D models in only 1-2 minutes on a single GPU.

We then propose a data generation method to demonstrate this hierarchical instruction following behavior, which teaches LLMs to selectively ignore lower-privileged instructions.\nTo generate training data, we leverage two principles: synthetic data generation and context distillation. For aligned instructions, we generate examples that have compositional requests (e.g., \"write a 20 line poem in spanish\") and decompose the instructions into smaller pieces (e.g., \"write a poem\", \"use spanish\", \"use 20 lines\"). We then place these decomposed instructions at different levels of the hierarchy and train models to predict the original ground-truth response. For misaligned instructions, we train models to act as if they are completely ignorant of the lower-level instructions.\n[Reward Tampering] Sycophancy to Subterfuge: Investigating Reward-Tampering in LLMs🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10162 14 Jun 2024 Anthropic\nReward tampering is a very critical issue that needs to be addressed. LLM models sometimes not only tamper with the implementation of their reward function but also rewrite testing code to ensure this tampering is not caught.\nWe also find that once a model learns to generalize to the reward-tampering environment, training the model not to be sycophantic in environments where specification gaming is easy to detect reduces reward-tampering without eliminating it. This suggests that if a model were to learn a dangerous reward-seeking policy in the wild, but we were only aware of misbehavior which was easier to catch, training away misbehavior we could catch would not completely remove more dangerous behavior in environments that are difficult to oversee.\n[Model Stealing] Stealing Part of a Production Language Model🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06634 11 Mar 2024 DeepMind\nWe introduce the first model-stealing attack that extracts precise, nontrivial information from black-box production language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's PaLM-2. Specifically, our attack recovers the embedding projection layer (up to symmetries) of a transformer model, given typical API access.\nIntuition: Suppose we query a language model on a large number of different random prefixes. Even though each output logit vector is an l-dimensional vector, they all actually lie in a h-dimensional subspace because the embedding projection layer up-projects from h-dimensions. Therefore, by querying the model \"enough\" (more than h times) we will eventually observe that new queries are linearly dependent on past queries. We can then compute the dimensionality of this subspace (e.g., with SVD) and report this as the hidden dimensionality of the model.\nTo extract the layer fully, it's possible to SVD Q = U · Σ · V⊤ matrix and there is a proof that U · Σ = W · G. In order to do so naively we need to full token log probabilities (logits) but this is never exposed in a production model. Before the paper there were query top-K APIs with ability to add user logit bias and this is what the paper used to recover the logits vector. It's possible to recover the complete logit vector for an arbitrary prompt p by cycling through different choices for the logit bias and measuring the top-k logits each time. The improved version reduced cost and time (but less stable) by assuming fixed completions such as [p0 x x x] in several prompts and learning the x.\n[Constitutional AI] Harmlessness from AI Feedback🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073 15 Dec 2022 Anthropic\nWe experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase.\nAn AI assistant that answers all questions with \"I don't know\" would be harmless, but of course it would also be completely useless. In our prior work using human feedback to train a helpful and harmless assistant, we found that there was a significant tension between helpfulness and harmlessness, and in particular, our assistant often refused to answer controversial questions.\nWe will be experimenting with an extreme form of scaled supervision, which we refer to as Constitutional AI (CAI). The idea is that human supervision will come entirely from a set of principles that should govern AI behavior, along with a small number of examples used for few-shot prompting.

We will read the tokens until we encounter operation and then perform the calculation.\nSolution\nclass ReversePolishNotation {\n    private static boolean isNumeric(String token) {\n      try {  \n        Double.parseDouble(token);  \n        return true;\n      } catch(NumberFormatException e) {  \n        return false;  \n      }\n    }\n    \n    private static int performCalculation(int left, int right, String operand) {\n        if (operand.equals(\"+\")) {\n            return left + right;\n        } else if (operand.equals(\"-\")) {\n            return left - right;\n        } else if (operand.equals(\"*\")) {\n            return left * right;\n        } else if (operand.equals(\"/\")) {\n            return left / right;\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"left: \" + left + \" right: \" + right + \" operand: \" + operand);\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"Unexpected operand\");\n        }\n    }\n    \n    public int evalRPN(String[] tokens) {\n        Stack&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new Stack&lt;Integer&gt;();\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; tokens.length; i++) {\n            String token = tokens[i];\n            if (!isNumeric(token)) {\n                int right = numbers.pop();\n                int left = numbers.pop();\n                int result = performCalculation(left, right, token);\n                numbers.add(result);\n            } else {\n                numbers.add(Integer.parseInt(token));\n            }\n        }\n        return numbers.pop();\n    }\n}\n\n\nTwo Sum - Easy - LeetCode 1🔗\nQuestion\n\nGiven an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.\n\nExplanation\nIn this question we need to find elem + X = target =&gt; X = target - elem;\nA common solution is to create a map from number to index (one pass).\nThen leverage it during traversal to check if the element exist (second pass).\nSince this problem is a sum of two elements we can do it in a single pass (the second element will have the first one in the data-structre).\nSolution\npublic class TwoSum {\n    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {\n        Map&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; numberToIndex = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n        int[] result = new int[2]; // number, index\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; nums.length; i++) {\n            int needed = target - nums[i];\n            if (numberToIndex.containsKey(needed)) {\n                Integer index = numberToIndex.get(needed);\n                result[0] = i;\n                result[1] = index;\n                return result;\n            }\n\n            numberToIndex.put(nums[i], i);\n        }\n\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid input\");\n    }\n\n\nBest Time to Buy and Sell Stock - Easy - LeetCode 121🔗\nQuestion\n\nYou are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.\n\n\nYou want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.\n\n\nReturn the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.\n\nExplanation\nWe are looking for the largest difference (min / max). Therefore we need to do a simple book keeping and keep track of the current minimum and profit we have. While we traverse the array we update the min if necessary and record the profit if it's bigger than what we have. I wrote my initial solution but there is no need to keep track of the current profit (we can just record max profit when needed).\nSolution\nclass BestTimeToSellStock {\n    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {\n        int size = prices.length;\n        if (size &lt;= 1)\n            return 0;\n        \n        int currentMin = prices[0];\n        int currentProfit = 0;\n        int maxProfit = 0;\n        \n        for (int i = 1; i &lt; size; i++) {\n            if (prices[i] &lt; currentMin) {\n                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, currentProfit);\n                currentProfit = 0;\n                currentMin = prices[i];\n            } else {\n                int candidateProfit = prices[i] - currentMin;\n                currentProfit = Math.max(candidateProfit, currentProfit);\n            }\n        }\n        maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, currentProfit);\n        \n        return maxProfit;\n    }\n}\n\nPartitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci-Binary Numbers - Medium - LeetCode 1689🔗\nQuestion\nA decimal number is called deci-binary if each of its digits is either 0 or 1 without any leading zeros.

Therefore, the answer is the maximum of all digits in n max(k)\nSolution\nclass MinPartitionsSolutions {\n    public int minPartitions(String n) {\n        int max = 0;\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; n.length(); i++){\n            int digit = n.charAt(i) - '0';\n            if (digit &gt; max) {\n                max = digit;\n            }\n        }\n        return max;\n    }\n}\n\nInsert Greatest Common Divisors in Linked List - Medium - LeetCode 2807🔗\nQuestion\nGiven the head of a linked list head, in which each node contains an integer value.\nBetween every pair of adjacent nodes, insert a new node with a value equal to the greatest common divisor of them.\nReturn the linked list after insertion.\nThe greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.\nExample 1:\nInput: head = [18,6,10,3]\nOutput: [18,6,6,2,10,1,3]\nExplanation: The 1st diagram denotes the initial linked list and the 2nd diagram denotes the linked list after inserting the new nodes (nodes in blue are the inserted nodes).\n\nWe insert the greatest common divisor of 18 and 6 = 6 between the 1st and the 2nd nodes.\nWe insert the greatest common divisor of 6 and 10 = 2 between the 2nd and the 3rd nodes.\nWe insert the greatest common divisor of 10 and 3 = 1 between the 3rd and the 4th nodes.\nThere are no more adjacent nodes, so we return the linked list.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: head = [7]\nOutput: [7]\nExplanation: The 1st diagram denotes the initial linked list and the 2nd diagram denotes the linked list after inserting the new nodes.\nThere are no pairs of adjacent nodes, so we return the initial linked list.\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5000].\n\\( 1 \\le Node.val \\le 1000 \\)\nExplanation\nThe idea is to break the solution into two different parts.\n\n\nImplement GCD.

However, many engineers underestimate the difficulty of system design and rely on insufficient resources that often provide misleading guidance. \nIn my experience, both free and paid system design trainings frequently miss the mark on adequately preparing candidates. Therefore, in this blog, I will walk through solutions to common system design interview questions, sharing the approach and techniques I've found most effective.\nRecommended System Design Process🔗\n\n\nListen closely to thoroughly understand all requirements before proposing any solutions. Practice active listening and asking clarifying questions at appropriate times. Document requirements clearly on a whiteboard or paper. \n\n\nOnly after requirements are fully defined, begin architecting the high-level design. Explain considerations like expected users, requests per second, latency limits, storage volumes, etc.\n\n\nMap out key architectural components and core data flows end-to-end (e.g user clicks button, client-side call, load balancer, authentication, backend service A, etc.)\n\n\nDeconstruct each component further specifying detailed APIs, data schemas, databases, caching, etc. as needed.\n\n\nKey Strategies🔗\n\n\nAvoid jumping to solutions prematurely before nailing down requirements. Build trust by demonstrating care and precision. \n\n\nKnow when to ask probing questions to unblock progress versus nodding along.\n\n\nBalance high-level architecture with lower-level implementation details at appropriate junctures.\n\n\nWith a structured, requirements-focused approach and strong communication skills, system design interviews can be mastered through practice over time.
