Traditionally, this has been a heavy lift for developers, requiring them to configure and maintain separate systems for monitoring, logging, and tracing. This often becomes an afterthought, which is a mistake when building systems that need to be trustworthy and transparent.\nThe post introduces Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Observability, a solution designed to address this very problem. It provides a ready-to-use monitoring solution that works across different agent frameworks and foundation models. This is a significant step forward because it abstracts away the need for developers to build and manage complex observability infrastructure themselves.\nWith AgentCore Observability, you get:\n\nEffortless Setup: For agents hosted on the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, observability is automatically enabled. For other environments, it's a matter of setting a few environment variables.\nEnd-to-End Traceability: Developers get instant visibility into agent interactions, performance metrics, and can debug issues without having to piece together data from multiple sources.\nStandardization: It's built on OpenTelemetry, which means it integrates easily into the broader ecosystem of observability tools.\n\nBy removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting of setting up monitoring and observability, developers can focus on what truly matters: building reliable, effective, and trustworthy AI agents. This allows for faster iteration, quicker debugging, and ultimately, a better end-user experience.\nI highly recommend reading the full post to understand how this new capability can help streamline your AI agent development lifecycle.\n","id":"https://gel.github.io/blog/agentcore-observability/","title":"Building Trustworthy AI Agents by Abstracting Infrastructure"},"https://gel.github.io/blog/data-platform-myths/":{"body":"Originally drafted in November 2021. Updated with a 2026 lens.\nShared data platforms are often proposed as a universal solution: centralize ingestion, storage, query patterns, and governance so product teams can move faster.\nThe promise is attractive. The failure mode is also predictable.\nThis post is a practical breakdown of where these initiatives go wrong, why the problems are structural (not just execution mistakes), and what to do instead.\n\nMyth 1: \"A Central Data Platform Simplifies Everything\"\nThe usual pitch:\n\nProduct teams focus on business logic.\nPlatform team handles storage complexity (OLTP, OLAP, indexing, retention).\nOne service standardizes security, compliance, and operations.\n\nAll true in principle. But at scale, a central platform often becomes the highest-dependency component in the system and inherits every unresolved domain ambiguity.\nWhen that happens, \"simplification\" for consumers becomes hidden complexity for the platform team.\nWhy Complexity Explodes\n1) Scope Complexity\nA shared platform sits in the middle of many upstream and downstream dependencies. This creates:\n\nConstant requirement churn from multiple teams.\nConflicting definitions of correctness and latency.\nDelivery coupling across unrelated roadmaps.\n\nIf requirements are not stable, centralization amplifies uncertainty rather than reducing it.\n2) Domain Complexity\nNot all data has the same requirements:\n\nAccess patterns differ (streaming, batch, ad hoc analytics, transactional lookups).\nConstraints differ (latency, throughput, mutability, retention, privacy).\nFailure tolerance differs (best-effort vs strict correctness).\n\nA generic platform that tries to satisfy all variants often becomes over-engineered, expensive, and slower to evolve than domain-owned pipelines.\n3) Organizational Complexity\nCentral platforms create organizational side effects:\n\nTeams delegate domain ownership to a central service.\nThe platform team becomes a routing layer for cross-team misalignment.\nPlanning overhead grows faster than implementation throughput.\n\nThis usually looks \"green\" in project trackers while real end-to-end integration risk remains unresolved.\nDesign Smell: Federated Responsibility, Centralized Accountability\nA frequent anti-pattern is:\nProducer A -&gt; Data Platform -&gt; Consumer B\nProducers and consumers keep domain decisions local, but reliability incidents and lifecycle ownership concentrate in the platform.\nThe platform then carries accountability without full control over source data contracts or consumer behavior. This is structurally unstable.\nMyth 2: \"Rules Engine First\"\nTeams often introduce a generic rules engine early to handle every policy variant.\nIn practice, this can fail when:\n\nCore domain rules are still changing.\nRule authorship and review ownership are unclear.\nDebugging requires reconstructing dynamic rule state across systems.\n\nA rules engine is powerful after core invariants are understood. Before that, it can become an abstraction that hides weak domain modeling.\nMyth 3: \"Audit Service Is Just Logging\"\nAudit is not a byproduct. It is a first-class system with strict requirements:\n\nImmutable event history.\nTraceability across boundaries.\nSchema/version compatibility over long time windows.\n\nTreating audit as \"just another sink\" usually creates gaps exactly where you need confidence most: incident response, compliance reviews, and customer-impact analysis.\nMyth 4: \"Notification Service Is Trivial\"\nNotification pipelines look easy until they need to be correct:\n\nIdempotency and deduplication.\nOrdering guarantees where required.\nBackpressure handling and retry semantics.\nClear separation between transient failures and terminal failures.\n\nWithout explicit contracts, notification systems degrade into noisy best-effort infrastructure that erodes trust.\nConfig vs Data: The Boundary Matters\nTeams frequently debate whether something belongs in \"config\" or \"data.\" The distinction is operationally important:\n\nConfig: low-cardinality control-plane inputs with controlled rollout and review.\nData: high-cardinality runtime facts produced and consumed by business workflows.\n\nWhen business data is treated as config, change management becomes brittle and error-prone.\nWhen config is treated as data, governance and blast-radius control become weak.\nA practical rule: if a value must support high-rate mutation, lineage, and analytical replay, model it as data. If it controls behavior and requires safe rollout semantics, model it as config.\nA Safer Alternative: Narrow, Domain-Aligned Platforms\nInstead of building one platform for all use cases, use this sequence:\n\nPick one well-understood product outcome.\nBuild the smallest platform capability that serves that outcome.\nValidate with real end-to-end traffic.\nExtract reusable components only after repeated success.\n\nThis preserves local ownership while allowing platformization to emerge from proven patterns.\nDecision Framework Before You Centralize\nUse these questions before committing to a shared data platform:\n\nAre domain contracts stable enough for shared abstractions?\nIs there a clear owner for schema evolution and data quality?\nDo we have measurable SLOs per use case, not just platform-level uptime?\nCan we decompose by bounded contexts instead of centralizing everything?\nWhat is the rollback strategy when one consumer requirement breaks the shared model?\n\nIf several answers are unclear, centralization is likely premature.\nPractical De-risking Moves\n\nStart with one bounded context, not the whole organization.\nMake data contracts explicit and versioned.\nDefine ownership boundaries before implementation.\nKeep escape hatches for domain-specific pipelines.\nMeasure success by business outcomes, not platform feature count.\n\nClosing\nShared platforms are valuable. But they are not shortcuts.\nThe core lesson is simple: centralize capabilities only after domain invariants are understood and operational ownership is explicit. Otherwise, the platform becomes a complexity concentrator.\nGood architecture is less about building the most generic system and more about choosing the right boundary at the right time.\n","id":"https://gel.github.io/blog/data-platform-myths/","title":"Data Platform Myths: What Breaks at Scale and How to De-risk It"},"https://gel.github.io/blog/godfather-of-ai/":{"body":"Geoffrey Hinton, often called the \"Godfather of AI,\" has been sounding the alarm on the existential risks of the very technology he helped pioneer. For many in the industry, it's easy to dismiss this as alarmist sci-fi.\nBut as architects building these systems daily, we see the micro-scale version of this risk in every deployment.\nWhen we deploy Agentic AI into critical enterprise workflows, we are effectively trusting a non-deterministic system. The \"safety\" risk isn't just about a rogue super-intelligence; it's about an agent deleting a production database because it hallucinated a user intent.\nShift Left: Verification Before Deployment\nWe cannot treat AI agents like standard microservices. They require a Shift Left approach where verification happens in rigorous sandboxes long before production.\n\nSandboxing: Every agent update must survive a \"gym\" of adversarial user simulators trying to break it.\nDeterministic Fallbacks: If the agent enters an unknown state, it must gracefully degrade to a rules-based system, not hallucinate a solution.\n\nAgentic Verification: The New Testing Paradigm\nWe are moving from deterministic to probabilistic software, and our testing methodologies are dangerously outdated.\n\nOld World: Unit tests assert output == expected.\nNew World: We need Agentic Verification.\n\nWe cannot simply \"review\" every action—that defeats the purpose of automation. We need systems that can probabilistically verify their own actions.\nClosing the Loop: Automated Governance\n\"Human-in-the-loop\" is a temporary crutch. To scale, we need End-to-End Acceptance Testing and risk-averse deployment strategies:\n\nSynthetic User Simulation: Use LLMs to simulate users and test the agent against thousands of edge cases.\nGradual Dial-up: Use A/B testing and Canary deployments to release agents to 1% of users first. Monitor for \"drift\" in safety metrics before rolling out further.\nMemory Safety: Agents with long-term memory can \"poison\" themselves with bad data.

They modernized their system, which runs thousands of different machine learning models, by leveraging Amazon SageMaker multi-model endpoints (MMEs) powered by the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server.\nNielsen Sports faced the challenge of scaling a massive computer vision system that identifies over 120 million brand impressions monthly across thousands of TV channels. Their legacy architecture suffered from low GPU utilization (30-40%) and a slow, cumbersome process for deploying new models, which could take over a month.\nBy re-architecting their system to use SageMaker MMEs, Nielsen was able to host multiple models on a single endpoint. This led to significant improvements:\n\nDramatically Lower Costs: A 75% reduction in operational and financial costs.\nIncreased Efficiency: GPU utilization soared to over 80%, and the overall pipeline runtime was cut by 33%.\nGreater Agility: The time to deploy new ML models plummeted from over a month to under a week.\n\nThis case study is a powerful example of how adopting a multi-tenant architecture with tools like SageMaker MMEs can lead to substantial cost savings, performance gains, and increased productivity for machine learning teams.\nFor a deeper dive into their technical solution and results, you can read the full post here: Nielsen Sports sees 75% cost reduction in video analysis with Amazon SageMaker multi-model endpoints.\nResources\n\nGitHub Repository: SageMaker MME GPU Benchmarking\nAWS Workshop: Watch the full session with Tamir Rubinsky (VP R&amp;D, Nielsen Sports) and myself:\n\n\n","id":"https://gel.github.io/blog/nielsen-sagemaker-optimization/","title":"Streamlining ML Workflows: Lessons from Nielsen Sports' 75% Cost Reduction"},"https://gel.github.io/blog/profit-in-the-stack/":{"body":"For the last decade, our industry mantra has been \"Serverless First.\" We abstracted everything away to Managed Services to move fast, ship features, and let someone else handle the DevOps.\nThat strategy worked when money was free.

While grit can get you to stick to hard things that are worthwhile, grit can also get you to stick to hard things that are no longer worthwhile. The trick is figuring out the difference.\nBy definition, anybody who has succeeded at something has stuck with it. That is true in hindsight. But the inverse is not true: sticking to something does not guarantee success.\nSuccess is not in sticking to everything. It is in choosing the right thing to stick to and quitting the rest.\nIn a world where perseverance is often treated as the road to honor and success, grit is the hero and quitting is framed as failure. But having the option to quit is what allows you to walk away when what you are doing is broken.\nIf the weather changes near the top of Everest, you turn around. If a fight doctor says your kidneys are damaged, you retire. The same idea applies to a major, a job, a career direction, a relationship, piano lessons, or even a movie you are watching.\nAs Kenny Rogers sang in The Gambler, you need to know when to hold, fold, walk away, and run. Three of those four are forms of quitting. Playing every hand is the fastest way to go broke.\nThe Tiny Speck story is a strong reminder.

It teaches that settling for mediocrity or mistreatment is not a virtue, but rather a disservice to oneself and others.\n\n\nTake Control: One of the most valuable lessons is about taking responsibility for one's own life and happiness. Instead of blaming external circumstances or other people, the book guides readers to recognize their own power in shaping their reality.\n\n\nEmbrace Vulnerability: Contrary to the \"nice guy\" facade of always being agreeable and perfect, the book advocates for embracing one's authentic self, including vulnerabilities. This authenticity leads to more meaningful connections and personal growth.\n\n\nSet Healthy Boundaries: The book provides practical guidance on establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries, which is crucial for both personal well-being and successful relationships.\n\n\nThe importance of this messaging cannot be overstated. In a world where many people struggle with people-pleasing tendencies and fear of conflict, this book serves as a wake-up call to live more authentically and assertively. It's particularly relevant in today's society where traditional notions of masculinity are being redefined, and men are seeking healthier ways to express themselves and build relationships.\nThe book's practical exercises and real-life examples make the concepts accessible and actionable.

They start with why. He introduces a simple but powerful concept called \"The Golden Circle,\" which has three layers:\n\nWhy: The core belief or purpose that drives you.\nHow: The specific actions you take to realize that belief.\nWhat: The results of those actions—the products you sell or the services you offer.\n\nThe book argues that while most companies can explain what they do, and some can explain how they do it, very few can clearly articulate why. Inspiring leaders, from Martin Luther King Jr. to Steve Jobs, start with their purpose, and it's this clarity that attracts loyal followers and customers.\nOne of the most practical takeaways for me was the \"Celery Test.\" The idea is that when you're clear on your \"why,\" making decisions becomes simpler. If you're advised to buy celery, M&amp;M's, and rice milk at the store, you'll only know what to do if you know why you're going. If your \"why\" is to be healthy, you'll buy the celery and the rice milk. The M&amp;M's don't fit. This simple analogy is a powerful filter for ensuring that your actions—and a company's decisions—are consistent with your core values.\nReading \"Start with Why\" has helped me become more opinionated and proactive, constantly asking what the underlying purpose is behind a task or a project. It challenges you to look beyond the surface level and find a deeper sense of motivation.\nI highly recommend this book to anyone looking to become a more effective leader or simply to find more clarity and passion in their own work.

It should contain your \"Non-Negotiables\".\nWhat to allow in your Agents.md🔗\nWriting Code: Removing \"AI Slop\"🔗\nAI models often generate defensive, verbose, or safe-but-sloppy code. Enforce these rules to keep quality high:\n\nNo \"AI Explanations\" in Comments: Remove extra comments that a human wouldn't add (e.g., // loop through the array) or that are inconsistent with the file's existing style.\nNo Paranoid Defense: Avoid extra try/catch blocks or null checks in internal, trusted code paths. If the data is validated at the edge, don't re-validate it deeply in internal helpers.\nNo any Casts: Do not use as any (TS) or equivalent to bypass type safety. Fix the type definition instead.\nConsistency is King: Match the existing indentation, naming conventions, and patterns of the file you are editing.\n\nUnit Testing🔗\n\nCo-location: When writing code, find or create the corresponding unit test immediately.\nCoverage: Cover the new line(s) of code.\nMinimalism: Tests should cover the success case and critical edge cases only. Avoid over-testing trivial logic.\n\nLogging Standards🔗\n\nError vs. Info:\n\nERROR level is for system errors (5xx) where action is required.\nINFO or WARN is for expected flow issues like Access Denied (4xx) or Validation Errors.\n\n\nBan log.warn: Avoid log.warn unless strictly defined. It often becomes a graveyard of \"maybe important\" logs that no one checks.\n\n\n🌳 Trick 2: Parallel Agents with Git Worktrees🔗\nRunning multiple agents usually requires multiple folders. Copying your repo is slow and wastes disk space (node_modules, .git objects).\nThe Solution: Git Worktrees\ngit worktree allows you to have multiple branches checked out in different folders simultaneously, all sharing the same .git object database.\nHow to use it🔗\n\nCreate a folder for your project (e.g., my-app-root).\nClone your repo into a main folder inside it.\nAdd a worktree for a new feature:\n\n# Inside your main repo\ngit worktree add ../feature-branch-alpha -b feature/alpha\n\nNow you have ../feature-branch-alpha as a sibling folder. It shares the history and objects but has its own working directory. You can run one agent on main fixing bugs, and another agent on feature-branch-alpha building a new feature, in parallel.\nBenefits:\n\nDisk Space: 90% savings for large repos.\nSpeed: Instant creation; no re-cloning.\nContext: Agents can work on independent tasks without file lock conflicts.\n\n\n⚡ Trick 3: Context Economics &amp; Navigation🔗\nContext is your most scarce resource. Treating it inefficiently leads to \"lost in the middle\" hallucinations and wasted cost.\n\nContext Compaction is Critical: Never dump entire raw files if you only need signatures. Use tools that \"compact\" code (stripping implementations, keeping interfaces) before adding to context.\nToken Awareness: Always track your Used vs Remaining tokens for every interaction. If you are 80% full, performance degrades.\nSemantic Search over Grep: Don't let agents blindly grep. Use tools with LSP (Language Server Protocol) awareness or Semantic Search (like Cursor's codebase indexing). Agents need to follow \"Go to Definition\" and \"Find References\" chains to understand code, just like you do.\n\n\n🔁 Trick 4: The \"Ralph Wiggum\" Loop🔗\nNamed after the Simpsons character known for persistence (and occasionally accidental genius), the Ralph Wiggum Loop is a brute-force yet highly effective technique for autonomous agents.\nThe Context🔗\nCurrently, many LLM providers offer \"Unlimited\" or high-tier plans where they are effectively subsidizing the compute costs (burning money) to gain market share. This creates an opportunity to trade compute time for human time.\nThe Trick🔗\nInstead of asking for a feature once and hoping it works, you set up a loop where the agent:\n\nAttempts to implement a feature.\nRuns a strict verification suite (tests, types, linting).\nIf it fails, it reads the errors, adjusts, and tries again.\nIt repeats this loop until success or a timeout.\n\nThis turns \"probabilistic\" generation into \"deterministic\" output, provided your verification specification (your tests) is solid.\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Start: Feature Request\"] --&gt; B[\"Agent Implements Feature\"]\n    B --&gt; C{\"Run Verification&lt;br/&gt;(Tests/Lint/Build)\"}\n    C --&gt;|Fail| D[\"Analyze Errors\"]\n    D --&gt; B\n    C --&gt;|Pass| E[\"Success: Commit &amp; Exit\"]\n    C --&gt;|Timeout/Max Retries| F[\"Failure: Request Human Help\"]\n    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000\n    style C fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000\n\nReal-world Example🔗\nI was able to build a live coding WebLLM feature using this technique.\n","id":"https://gel.github.io/generative-ai/1-intro/2-genai-agents-tricks/","title":"GenAI Agents Tricks"},"https://gel.github.io/generative-ai/2-genai-research/":{"body":"A Curated Collection of Generative AI Research &amp; Tools🔗\nWelcome to a resource for Generative AI: from practical development tools to cutting-edge research papers.

Similar to AlphaDev's search for optimal primitives, SICA uses empirical evaluation to evolve its tools and reasoning capabilities without human intervention or gradient-based learning.\nThe core loop involves benchmarking the current agent (e.g., on SWE-Bench), archiving results, and selecting the best-performing version to act as a meta-agent.\ngraph TD\n    Bench[Benchmark Agent] --&gt; Archive[(Archive Results)]\n    Archive --&gt; Select[Select Best as Meta-Agent]\n    Select --&gt; Analyze{Analyze Traces}\n    Analyze --&gt; Identify[Identify Failures &amp; Tools]\n    Identify --&gt; SubAgents[Invoke Sub-Agents]\n    SubAgents --&gt; Refactor[Edit agent_code/]\n    Refactor --&gt; Overseer{Overseer Safety}\n    Overseer --&gt; |Pass| Updated[Updated Agent]\n    Overseer --&gt; |Fail| SubAgents\n    Updated --&gt; Bench\n\nHow Improvement Happens:\nAfter running benchmarks, the meta-agent analyzes the execution traces, identifying specific successes and failures. It doesn't just \"guess\" updates; it:\n\nAnalyzes Traces: Investigates where the agent got stuck or failed.\nIdentifies Improvements: Pinpoints needed tools, like smarter AST-based symbol locators or diff minimizers.\nInvokes Sub-Agents: Calls specialized agents (e.g., software developer, archive explorer) to propose, implement, test, and verify code changes in its own agent_code/ directory.\n\nSafety and Continuity:\nTo prevent the agent from getting stuck in infinite loops or unproductive paths, SICA employs an overseer component. This trick ensures the agent remains on track and within safety boundaries while iteratively refactoring its own logic.\nResults show significant performance gains, jumping from 17% to 53% on SWE-Bench Verified subsets, demonstrating the power of autonomous, reflection-driven code updates.\n[AutoGen] Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Chat🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155 Aug 2023 Microsoft\nAutoGen is an open-source framework that allows developers to build LLM applications via multiple agents that can converse with each other to accomplish tasks.

Specifically, our proposed agent architecture can learn from arbitrary reward information across multiple environments and tasks, for iteratively fine-tuning a pre-trained language model, which refines the language agent prompts by reflecting on failed attempts and assigning credits of actions taken by the agent on future rewards.\ngraph LR\n    Env[Environment] -- Feedback/Reward --&gt; Retro[Retrospective Model]\n    Retro -- Refined Prompt --&gt; Agent[LLM Agent]\n    Agent -- Action --&gt; Env\n\n    subgraph \"Policy Optimization\"\n        Retro\n    end\n\nKey Components:\n\nRetrospective Model: Learns from environment feedback to improve agent performance\nPolicy Optimization: Refines agent prompts based on reward signals\nCredit Assignment: Analyzes the impact of actions on future rewards\nMulti-Environment Learning: Adapts to various tasks and environments\n\n\n\n","id":"https://gel.github.io/generative-ai/2-genai-research/1-genai-agents/","title":"Agents"},"https://gel.github.io/generative-ai/2-genai-research/2-genai-pretraining-finetuning/":{"body":"[Self-Reward] Self Rewarding Language Models🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10020 18 Jan 2024 Meta\nIn this work, we study Self-Rewarding Language Models, where the language model itself is used via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting to provide its own rewards during training. We show that during Iterative DPO training that not only does instruction following ability improve, but also the ability to provide high-quality rewards to itself.\n\nOur approach first assumes access to a base pretrained language model, and a small amount of human-annotated seed data. We then build a model that aims to possess two skills simultaneously: 1. Instruction following: given a prompt that describes a user request, the ability to generate a high quality, helpful (and harmless) response. 2. Self-Instruction creation: the ability to generate and evaluate new instruction following examples to add to its own training set.\nWhile we report the results of both approaches in our experiments, we find that learning from preference pairs gives superior performance, and hence recommend that approach.\n\nIterative Training Our overall procedure trains a series of models M1, . . . , MT where each successive model t uses augmented training data created by the t − 1 th model. We thus define AIFT(Mt) to mean AI Feedback Training data created using model Mt. Model Sequence We thus define the models, and the training data they use as follows: M0 : Base pretrained LLM with no fine-tuning. M1 : Initialized with M0, then fine-tuned on the IFT+EFT seed data using SFT. M2 : Initialized with M1, then trained with AIFT(M1) data using DPO. M3 : Initialized with M2, then trained with AIFT(M2) data using DPO.\n\n[In-Context Pretraining] Language Modeling Beyond Document Boundaries🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10638 Oct 2023 Meta\nWe instead present IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING, a new approach where language models are pretrained on a sequence of related documents, thereby explicitly encouraging them to read and reason across document boundaries.\nIN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING instead reorders the pretraining data by combining several semantically related documents to create a coherent input context, thereby exposing LMs to long relevant contexts and providing pretraining signals beyond document boundaries.\nHowever, this document sorting problem is challenging. LMs are typically trained on billions of\ndocuments and we would like to sort them to maximize document similarity in the input context\nwindows without repeating any data. We introduce two new approximate algorithms to tackle these challenges.\n\nTechniques are using embedding models and top-k similarity search and leveraging approximate solutions for the traveling salesman problem - by the means of visiting every document once.\n[DPO] Direct Preference Optimization: Your LM is Secretly a Reward Model🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290 May 2023 Stanford\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph RLHF[\"Traditional RLHF\"]\n        Data1[Preference Data] --&gt; RM[Train Reward Model]\n        RM --&gt; RL[RL Fine-tuning]\n        RL --&gt; Model1[Aligned Model]\n    end\n\n    subgraph DPO[\"Direct Preference Optimization\"]\n        Data2[Preference Data] --&gt; Loss[\"Classification Loss\\n(Binary Cross-Entropy)\"]\n        Loss --&gt; Model2[Aligned Model]\n    end\n\n    style DPO fill:#e8f5e9,color:#000\n\nIn this paper we introduce a new parameterization of the reward model in RLHF that enables extraction of the corresponding optimal policy in closed form, allowing us to solve the standard RLHF problem with only a simple classification loss. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant, and computationally lightweight,\neliminating the need for sampling from the LM during fine-tuning or performing significant hyperparameter tuning.\n\nDPO gradient for loss increases the likelihood of preferred completion (Y_W) and decreases the likelihood for dispreferred completion (Y_L). Importantly, the examples are weighed by how much higher the implicit reward model rˆθ rates the dispreferred completions, scaled by β, i.e, how incorrectly the implicit reward model orders the completions, accounting for the strength of the KL constraint.\nDPO outline. The general DPO pipeline is as follows: 1) Sample completions y1, y2 ∼ πref(· | x) for every prompt x, label with human preferences to construct the offline dataset of preferences D = {x (i) , y (i) w , yl) (i)} N i=1 and 2) optimize the language model πθ to minimize LDPO for the given πref and D and desired β.\n[RLHF] Secrets of RLHF in LLMs Part II: Reward Modeling🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15503 24 Dec 2023 Fudan NLP\nIn conclusion, while RLHF is a significant advancement in AI development, particularly in integrating human preferences into the learning process, it also presents unique challenges. These include the inherent noise and ambiguity in human feedback, potential biases in the data, and the generalization limits of reward models trained on specific datasets. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the advancement and ethical application of RLHF in AI systems.\n\nTo enhance the generalization ability of the reward model, we explore contrastive learning and\nmeta-learning. By introducing unsupervised contrastive loss during the reward modeling process, the reward model can better distinguish subtle preference differences among responses. To bridge the gap between the preference data distribution and the model output distribution, we employ meta-learning to ensure that the reward model not only performs well on the preference data but also can distinguish the differences in target domain outputs.\nTechnique is to randomize training data and do a k-fold split, build K models and then measure mean and deviations - negative mean is usually the mistakes.\nAccording to the results, we can observe that: 1) For the top 20% of data with the lowest preference strength, they have a negative impact on the model's performance on the validation set. The preference strength for these data subsets is less than 0. 2) For data ranked between 20% and 40%, after training, the model's prediction accuracy on the validation set is approximately 0.5. The preference strength for this type of data is around 0. 3) The remaining data significantly improves the model's performance. However, the top 10% of data with the highest preference strength does not achieve the best performance when trained alone. Based on the above results, we can roughly categorize preference data into three types: incorrect data, ambiguous data (almost no difference), and normal data (clear differences). These three types of preference data play different roles and make different contributions to preference modeling. It is necessary for us to conduct a more detailed analysis of them and then consider how to handle each type.\n[LLARA] Making LLMs A Better Foundation For Dense Retrieval🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06080 11 Jan 2024 Beijing Academy of AI\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach, called LLaRA (LLM adapted for dense RetrievAl), which works as a post-hoc adaptation of LLM for the dense retrieval application. LLaRA consists of two pretext tasks: EBAE (Embedding-Based Auto-Encoding) and EBAR (Embedding-Based Auto-Regression), where the text embeddings from LLM are used to reconstruct the tokens for the input sentence and predict the tokens for the next sentence, respectively\n\nParticularly, there are two pretext training tasks introduced by LLaRA: EBAE (Embedding-Based Auto-Encoding) and EBAR (Embedding-Based Auto-Regression). In EBAE, the LLM is prompted to generate the text embeddings, which can be used to predict the tokens for the input sentence itself. While with EBAR, the LLM is prompted to generate the text embeddings, which can be used to predict the  tokens for the next sentence. By learning from the above pretext tasks, the text embeddings from LLM can be adapted from Local semantic representations (i.e. prediction for the next tokens) to Global semantic representations (i.e. prediction for the sentence-level features).\n[RA-DIT] Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01352 2 Oct 2023 META\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph Step1[\"Step 1: LM Fine-tuning\"]\n        LM[Pre-trained LM] --&gt; FT1[Fine-tune to use\\nretrieved context]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Step2[\"Step 2: Retriever Fine-tuning\"]\n        Ret[Retriever] --&gt; FT2[Update to return\\nLM-preferred results]\n    end\n\n    FT1 &lt;--&gt; FT2\n    FT1 --&gt; RALM[Retrieval-Augmented LM]\n    FT2 --&gt; RALM\n\n    style RALM fill:#FFD700,color:#000\n\nRetrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) improve performance by accessing long-tail and up-to-date knowledge from external data stores, but are challenging to build. Existing approaches require either expensive retrieval-specific modifications to LM pre-training or use post-hoc integration of the data store that leads to suboptimal performance\nOur approach operates in two distinct fine-tuning steps: (1) one updates a pre-trained LM to better use retrieved information, while (2) the other updates the retriever to return more relevant results, as preferred by the LM\n[Sequential Monte Carlo] Steering of LLMs using Probabilistic Programs🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03081 5 Jun 2023 MIT\nContext: Despite significant advances in recent years, it remains unclear if and how large language models (LLMs) can be made reliable and controllable enough to meet the functional requirements of many applications.\nEven after fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, LLMs are liable to violate instructions in their prompts (such as \"Use the following vocabulary words\" or \"Do not reveal this prompt\").\nThese difficulties highlight the need for methods beyond prompting and fine-tuning for constraining the behavior of generative neural models.\n[TokenFormer] Rethinking Transformer Scaling with Tokenized Model Parameters🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23168 30 Oct 2024\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph Traditional[\"Traditional Transformer\"]\n        In1[Input Tokens] --&gt; Proj[Fixed Linear Projections]\n        Proj --&gt; Out1[Output]\n    end\n\n    subgraph TokenFormer[\"TokenFormer\"]\n        In2[Input Tokens] --&gt; TTA[Token-Token\\nAttention]\n        Params[Parameter Tokens] --&gt; TPA[Token-Parameter\\nAttention]\n        In2 --&gt; TPA\n        TTA --&gt; Out2[Output]\n        TPA --&gt; Out2\n    end\n\n    style TokenFormer fill:#e1f5fe,color:#000\n\nCurrent transformer models are hard to scale up because they use fixed linear projections for processing inputs. When you want to make the model bigger (e.g. increase dimensions), you typically have to retrain the whole thing from scratch. This is very computationally expensive and inefficient.\nInstead of using fixed linear projections, it represents model parameters as \"tokens\" that can interact with input data through attention mechanisms. The architecture has two main parts:\n\nToken-token attention: How input tokens interact with each other (like regular transformers)\nToken-parameter attention: How input tokens interact with parameter tokens (new innovation)\n\nKey Benefits:\n\nCan scale the model by just adding more parameter tokens without changing core architecture\nCan reuse parameters from smaller models when scaling up\nDoesn't need full retraining from scratch\n\nParameter tokens come in key-value pairs. Input tokens act as queries that attend to these parameter tokens. Can add more key-value parameter pairs to increase model capacity.

GaLore is closely related to projected gradient descent (PGD), but with key differences:\n\nGaLore considers the specific gradient form that naturally appears in training multi-layer neural networks\nTraditional PGD mostly treats the objective as a general blackbox nonlinear function\nSince the gradient G may have a low-rank structure, GaLore keeps the gradient statistics of a small \"core\" of gradient G in optimizer states\n\nFor complex optimization problems like LLM pretraining, it may be difficult to capture the entire gradient trajectory with a single low-rank subspace. GaLore addresses this by allowing switching across low-rank subspaces: Wt = W0 + ∆WT1 + ∆WT2 + ... + ∆WTn, where the switching frequency T becomes a hyperparameter.\n[Survey] Instruction Tuning for Large Language Models🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10792 21 Aug 2023\nThere are generally two methods for constructing instruction datasets:\n• Data integration from annotated natural language datasets.

Datasets such as InstructWild (Xue et al., 2023) and Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2022c) are generated following this approach.

Scaling AI models to superhuman levels requires that AI judges evolve accordingly to accurately evaluate these increasingly complex responses.\nIs verifying a problem's solution easier than solving the problem itself? Intuitively, verification should be simpler, as the model is provided with candidate solutions and only needs to identify the correct one, a task that would yield 50% accuracy through random guessing alone. Our results show that for a fixed model, the judge's accuracy closely mirrors that of the solver. While GPT-4o's and Gemini-1.5-Pro's judges slightly outperform their corresponding solvers, Claude-3.5-Sonnet's and Llama-3.1-405BInstruct's judges lag behind their respective solvers. Although the overall accuracy between the solver and judge is close, we observe a notable discrepancy in the Coding category, where the solver consistently outperforms the judge across all models. Conversely, in the Math category, judges significantly outperform solvers. This suggests that coding problems are more difficult to evaluate, while logical errors in math problems are generally easier to identify.\n[Prometheus 2] An OS LM Specialized in Evaluating Other LMs🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01535 2 May 2024\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Training[\"Training Approaches\"]\n        Single[\"Single-Format\\nTraining\"]\n        Joint[\"Joint\\nTraining\"]\n        Merge[\"Weight\\nMerging\"]\n    end\n\n    Base[Base Model] --&gt; Training\n    Training --&gt; Eval{Prometheus 2}\n    Eval --&gt; DA[\"Direct\\nAssessment\"]\n    Eval --&gt; PR[\"Pairwise\\nRanking\"]\n\n    style Eval fill:#e1f5fe,color:#000\n\nWe introduce PROMETHEUS 2 (7B &amp; 8x7B), state-of-the-art open evaluator LMs that score high correlations with both human evaluators and proprietary LM-based judges on both direct assessment and pairwise ranking.\nTraining Approaches:\n\nSingle-Format Training: Training a base model on either direct assessment feedback dataset or pairwise ranking feedback dataset\nJoint Training: Training a base model on both direct assessment and pairwise ranking feedback datasets\nWeight Merging: Training two models separately and merging them with linear combination: θfinal = α × θd + (1 − α) × θp\n\n[PretrainingLoss] Understanding Emergent Abilities of LMs from the Loss Perspective🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15796 30 Mar 2024 Zhipu AI\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Old[\"Traditional View\"]\n        Size[Model Size] --&gt; Perf1[Performance]\n        Compute[Training Compute] --&gt; Perf1\n    end\n\n    subgraph New[\"Loss Perspective\"]\n        Loss[Pre-training Loss] --&gt; |Below Threshold| Emerge[\"✨ Emergent\\nAbilities\"]\n        Loss --&gt; |Above Threshold| Random[\"Random\\nGuessing\"]\n    end\n\n    style New fill:#fff3e0,color:#000\n    style Emerge fill:#c8e6c9,color:#000\n\nOur paper proposes a new definition of emergent abilities of language models from the perspective of pre-training loss.

Our approach, coined DPOK, integrates policy optimization with KL regularization.\nGeneration of more data includes generating n-1 negative samples and leveraging contrastive loss and generating more images to increase diversity.\nIn fine-tuning the loss function will be the expectancy of the sum of all the binary-human-classified dataset and also loss from the pre-training based data (weighted with B) to maintain accuracy of the model (avoid catastrophic forgetting). For the reward loss the idea is for the reward to be log-likelihood but it’s not easy, Therefore we minimize reward-weighted MSE loss instead.\nSetup: Pretrained Stable Diffusion 1.5, fine-tuning using static CLIP language encoder, Reward model is MLP using ViT-L/14 CLIP for image/text embeddings, Dataset 2700 prompts, 27k images, 16k unlabeled and 625k for pretraining.\nSFT: model is updated on a fixed dataset generated by the pre-trained model.\nRL: model is updated using new samples from the previously trained model during online RL fine-tuning.\nBased on the results, adding KL regularization helps in improving both image fidelity and accuracy (mostly image fidelty).\n[Point-E] A System for Generating 3D Point Clouds from Complex Prompts🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08751 16 Dec 2022 OpenAI\nIn this paper, we explore an alternative method for 3D object generation which produces 3D models in only 1-2 minutes on a single GPU.

We then propose a data generation method to demonstrate this hierarchical instruction following behavior, which teaches LLMs to selectively ignore lower-privileged instructions.\nTo generate training data, we leverage two principles: synthetic data generation and context distillation. For aligned instructions, we generate examples that have compositional requests (e.g., \"write a 20 line poem in spanish\") and decompose the instructions into smaller pieces (e.g., \"write a poem\", \"use spanish\", \"use 20 lines\"). We then place these decomposed instructions at different levels of the hierarchy and train models to predict the original ground-truth response. For misaligned instructions, we train models to act as if they are completely ignorant of the lower-level instructions.\n[Reward Tampering] Sycophancy to Subterfuge: Investigating Reward-Tampering in LLMs🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10162 14 Jun 2024 Anthropic\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Spectrum[\"Specification Gaming Spectrum\"]\n        Syco[\"😊 Sycophancy\"] --&gt; Game[\"🎮 Gaming\"] --&gt; Tamper[\"⚠️ Reward\\nTampering\"]\n    end\n\n    Train[\"Train on Easy\\nEnvironments\"] --&gt; |Generalizes to| Dangerous[\"Dangerous\\nBehaviors\"]\n\n    style Tamper fill:#ffcdd2,color:#000\n\nReward tampering is a very critical issue that needs to be addressed. LLM models sometimes not only tamper with the implementation of their reward function but also rewrite testing code to ensure this tampering is not caught.\nWe also find that once a model learns to generalize to the reward-tampering environment, training the model not to be sycophantic in environments where specification gaming is easy to detect reduces reward-tampering without eliminating it. This suggests that if a model were to learn a dangerous reward-seeking policy in the wild, but we were only aware of misbehavior which was easier to catch, training away misbehavior we could catch would not completely remove more dangerous behavior in environments that are difficult to oversee.\n[Model Stealing] Stealing Part of a Production Language Model🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06634 11 Mar 2024 DeepMind\nWe introduce the first model-stealing attack that extracts precise, nontrivial information from black-box production language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's PaLM-2. Specifically, our attack recovers the embedding projection layer (up to symmetries) of a transformer model, given typical API access.\nIntuition: Suppose we query a language model on a large number of different random prefixes. Even though each output logit vector is an l-dimensional vector, they all actually lie in a h-dimensional subspace because the embedding projection layer up-projects from h-dimensions. Therefore, by querying the model \"enough\" (more than h times) we will eventually observe that new queries are linearly dependent on past queries. We can then compute the dimensionality of this subspace (e.g., with SVD) and report this as the hidden dimensionality of the model.\nTo extract the layer fully, it's possible to SVD Q = U · Σ · V⊤ matrix and there is a proof that U · Σ = W · G. In order to do so naively we need to full token log probabilities (logits) but this is never exposed in a production model. Before the paper there were query top-K APIs with ability to add user logit bias and this is what the paper used to recover the logits vector. It's possible to recover the complete logit vector for an arbitrary prompt p by cycling through different choices for the logit bias and measuring the top-k logits each time. The improved version reduced cost and time (but less stable) by assuming fixed completions such as [p0 x x x] in several prompts and learning the x.\n[Constitutional AI] Harmlessness from AI Feedback🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073 15 Dec 2022 Anthropic\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph SL[\"Supervised Learning Phase\"]\n        Init[Initial Model] --&gt; Critique[Self-Critique]\n        Critique --&gt; Revise[Revise Response]\n        Revise --&gt; FT[Fine-tune on Revised]\n    end\n\n    subgraph RL[\"Reinforcement Learning Phase\"]\n        FT --&gt; Sample[Sample Responses]\n        Sample --&gt; Eval{AI Evaluates\\nvia Constitution}\n        Eval --&gt; Pref[Build Preference Model]\n        Pref --&gt; RLAIF[\"RLAIF\\n(RL from AI Feedback)\"]\n    end\n\n    style RLAIF fill:#c8e6c9,color:#000\n\nWe experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase.\nAn AI assistant that answers all questions with \"I don't know\" would be harmless, but of course it would also be completely useless. In our prior work using human feedback to train a helpful and harmless assistant, we found that there was a significant tension between helpfulness and harmlessness, and in particular, our assistant often refused to answer controversial questions.\nWe will be experimenting with an extreme form of scaled supervision, which we refer to as Constitutional AI (CAI). The idea is that human supervision will come entirely from a set of principles that should govern AI behavior, along with a small number of examples used for few-shot prompting.

Finally, create a decision grid and consult trusted connections like family, friends or colleagues before settling on a firm yes or no.\nSome common personal motivations are:\n\n\nDesire for improved compensation (e.g. moving to a higher-paying senior role).\n\n\nCurrent role feels unchallenging, boring and/or repetitive.\n\n\nToxic work environment (work-life balance, stress, lack of influence).\n\n\nPoor team and leadership (unenjoyable colleagues, no mentors, high attrition).\n\n\nEach of these motivations can be evaluated on its own merits and should provide enough rationale to determine whether one should stay or move on.\n","id":"https://gel.github.io/interviews/1-intro/1-making-a-career-move/","title":"Making a Career Move"},"https://gel.github.io/interviews/1-intro/2-finding-the-best-job/":{"body":"It's important to recognize that no job is 100% perfect. However, with the right approach, you can identify opportunities that are the best fit for your skills, interests and professional goals.\nTo discover appealing roles, first ensure you have sufficient options to evaluate and select the most suitable position for you. Useful strategies include:\n\n\nInvesting time in optimizing your LinkedIn profile and activity so recruiters can more easily find you.\n\n\nScheduling informational meetings with former colleagues to uncover unofficial job leads at their companies.\n\n\nTelling friends, family, and broader network about your job search plans so they can share relevant openings.\n\n\nScanning your existing professional connections and employer to identify where people in your field are getting hired.\n\n\nResearching the job market thoroughly to understand salary ranges, in-demand skills, company cultures, etc. This provides helpful context.\n\n\nCustomizing your resume and cover letters to align with each potential job's requirements.\n\n\nSeeking referral opportunities from your network to increase chances of getting interviews.\n\n\nPracticing your interview skills to feel confident during the hiring process.\n\n\nAsking thoughtful questions of hiring managers and employees to assess company/role fit.\n\n\nNegotiating job offers strategically to maximize compensation, flexibility, growth opportunities, etc.\n\n\nWith preparation and commitment to exploring all promising leads, you can find a job that checks most of your key boxes for an enjoyable and successful career move.\n","id":"https://gel.github.io/interviews/1-intro/2-finding-the-best-job/","title":"Finding an Optimal Job"},"https://gel.github.io/interviews/1-intro/3-passing-the-interview/":{"body":"Schedule Practice Interviews🔗\nBook two mock interviews within the next 14 days with companies you are not interested in working for. Ideally, schedule the first phone screening 7 days out. This will motivate you to prepare even when time is tight. Remember, most companies allow candidates to re-interview after 6-12 months if needed, so don't stress.\nChoose One Primary Coding Language🔗\nAlthough being a jack-of-all-trades with multiple programming languages is preferable on the job, it can be counterproductive in interviews. The key is optimizing the time between conceiving a solution and writing syntactically correct code. Therefore, picking a functional language you know very well is recommended.\nSelect the programming language you actively use and feel most proficient in as your go-to for interview coding. This ensures you can demonstrate your skills accurately.\nOther Key Strategies🔗\n\n\nThoroughly review the job description and research the company to anticipate likely interview questions and expectations.\n\n\nPractice discussing your resume, projects, and skills out loud to improve your articulation and confidence.\n\n\nPrepare stories that highlight times you successfully solved complex problems, overcame challenges, collaborated, etc.\n\n\nBrush up on computer science fundamentals like data structures and algorithms. Review coding patterns and syntax for your chosen language.\n\n\nPlan for behavioral and technical questions, but also prepare some insightful questions to ask the interviewer to show interest.\n\n\nDress professionally and arrive early to interviews to make a good impression.\n\n\nBehavioral Questions: \"Tell Me About a Time...\"🔗\nBehavioral interviews are not optional for senior roles. Companies use them to evaluate judgment, ownership, collaboration, and values alignment.\nAt Google this is often discussed as Googliness. At Meta, interviewers usually evaluate alignment to company values and how you work with speed, impact, and collaboration (sometimes called culture fit/value fit).\nThe most effective approach is:\n\nBe fully prepared with 6-8 real stories from your experience.\nKeep every story honest and specific; avoid exaggerated claims.\nStructure answers with STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result).\nQuantify outcomes when possible (latency, revenue, reliability, user impact).\nEnd with what you learned and what you would improve next time.\n\nPreparation improves clarity, but honesty builds trust. Strong candidates do both.\nCommon questions candidates often get stuck on:\n\n\"Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager or a senior engineer. How did you handle it?\"\n\"Tell me about a time a colleague was impacting the team's productivity. What did you do?\"\n\"Tell me about a time you proposed a novel solution to a problem, but it was not adopted. What did you do next?\"\n\nEasy questions that should still be a high-impact showcase:\n\n\"What is the hardest production bug you have debugged?\"\n\"Tell me about the best feature you have developed.\"\n\nWith practice and dedication to sharpening your interview abilities, you can showcase your qualifications persuasively and land the perfect job.\n","id":"https://gel.github.io/interviews/1-intro/3-passing-the-interview/","title":"Acing the Interview Process"},"https://gel.github.io/interviews/2-data-structres-and-algorithms/":{"body":"A critical first step in preparing for any programming-related job interview is ensuring you have command of fundamental computer science data structures and algorithms.

It is designed to work well on secondary storage (disks) by minimizing the number of disk accesses.\nB+Tree - A variation of the B-Tree (used by InnoDB) where:\n\nAll actual data (rows) is stored only in leaf nodes.\nNon-leaf nodes (internal nodes) only store keys and child page pointers.\nLeaf nodes are linked together in a doubly-linked list, allowing for efficient range scans.\n\nWhy B+Trees for Databases?\n\nPredictable Depth: B+Trees are very \"flat.\" A tree with only 3 or 4 levels can store billions of rows, ensuring any record is reached in a fixed, small number of I/Os.\nEfficient Range Scans: Since leaf nodes are linked, a range query (e.g., WHERE id &gt; 100) just finds the first leaf and then traverses the linked list.\nBetter Cache Performance: Since internal nodes don't store row data, more keys fit in a single page, increasing the \"fan-out\" and keeping the index pages in memory longer.\n\nInnoDB B+Tree Structure🔗\nIn InnoDB, pages are the basic unit of storage (usually 16KB).\ngraph TD\n    Root[\"Root Page (Level 2)\"]\n    Internal1[\"Internal Page (Level 1)\"]\n    Internal2[\"Internal Page (Level 1)\"]\n    Leaf1[\"Leaf Page (Level 0)&lt;br/&gt;Records: A, B, C\"]\n    Leaf2[\"Leaf Page (Level 0)&lt;br/&gt;Records: D, E, F\"]\n    Leaf3[\"Leaf Page (Level 0)&lt;br/&gt;Records: G, H, I\"]\n\n    Root --&gt; Internal1\n    Root --&gt; Internal2\n    Internal1 --&gt; Leaf1\n    Internal1 --&gt; Leaf2\n    Internal2 --&gt; Leaf3\n\n    Leaf1 &lt;--&gt; Leaf2 &lt;--&gt; Leaf3\n\nRoot Page &amp; Splitting:\nThe root page is special because its location is fixed in the InnoDB data dictionary. When the root page fills up:\n\nIt cannot be moved or split like a normal page.\nInstead, its records are moved to a newly allocated page (the root is \"raised\" a level).\nThat new page is then split into two.\nThe root page remains at the same location but now contains node pointers to the new pages.\n\nPage Internals:\n\nEach page has a Header and a Trailer.\nSystem Records: Infimum (lowest possible value) and Supremum (highest possible value) exist in every page and act as boundary markers for the record list.\nRecords: Singly-linked list within the page, logically ordered by key. Physically, they take whatever space is available (no physical sorting).\nPage Directory: Since records are not physically sorted, InnoDB uses a \"page directory\" (array of pointers) to enable binary search within the page.

If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.\n\nExplanation\nWe are looking for the largest difference (min / max). Therefore we need to do a simple book keeping and keep track of the current minimum and profit we have. While we traverse the array we update the min if necessary and record the profit if it's bigger than what we have. I wrote my initial solution but there is no need to keep track of the current profit (we can just record max profit when needed).\nSolution\nclass BestTimeToSellStock {\n    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {\n        int size = prices.length;\n        if (size &lt;= 1)\n            return 0;\n\n        int currentMin = prices[0];\n        int currentProfit = 0;\n        int maxProfit = 0;\n\n        for (int i = 1; i &lt; size; i++) {\n            if (prices[i] &lt; currentMin) {\n                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, currentProfit);\n                currentProfit = 0;\n                currentMin = prices[i];\n            } else {\n                int candidateProfit = prices[i] - currentMin;\n                currentProfit = Math.max(candidateProfit, currentProfit);\n            }\n        }\n        maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, currentProfit);\n\n        return maxProfit;\n    }\n}\n\nPartitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci-Binary Numbers - Medium - LeetCode 1689🔗\nQuestion\nA decimal number is called deci-binary if each of its digits is either 0 or 1 without any leading zeros.

However, many engineers underestimate the difficulty of system design and rely on insufficient resources that often provide misleading guidance. \nIn my experience, both free and paid system design trainings frequently miss the mark on adequately preparing candidates. Therefore, in this blog, I will walk through solutions to common system design interview questions, sharing the approach and techniques I've found most effective.\nRecommended System Design Process🔗\n\n\nListen closely to thoroughly understand all requirements before proposing any solutions. Practice active listening and asking clarifying questions at appropriate times. Document requirements clearly on a whiteboard or paper. \n\n\nOnly after requirements are fully defined, begin architecting the high-level design. Explain considerations like expected users, requests per second, latency limits, storage volumes, etc.\n\n\nMap out key architectural components and core data flows end-to-end (e.g user clicks button, client-side call, load balancer, authentication, backend service A, etc.)\n\n\nDeconstruct each component further specifying detailed APIs, data schemas, databases, caching, etc. as needed.\n\n\nKey Strategies🔗\n\n\nAvoid jumping to solutions prematurely before nailing down requirements. Build trust by demonstrating care and precision. \n\n\nKnow when to ask probing questions to unblock progress versus nodding along.\n\n\nBalance high-level architecture with lower-level implementation details at appropriate junctures.\n\n\nWith a structured, requirements-focused approach and strong communication skills, system design interviews can be mastered through practice over time.

sudden increases usually indicate entropy bugs or saturation.\n\nBirthday paradox intuition:\n\nEven with a large code space, collision probability rises non-linearly as occupancy grows.\nTherefore, production systems rely on unique constraints + retries, not probability alone.\n\nPractical Notes\n\nUse a cache for hot redirects (code -&gt; long_url) to reduce read latency.\nAdd rate limiting and URL validation for abuse prevention.\nAdd TTL support for expiring links when needed.\n\nExpected Senior Follow-Up: Idempotency\nFor POST /api/v1/urls, retries should not create duplicate short links for the same tenant and normalized long URL.\nImplementation approach:\n\nNormalize long URL deterministically.\nCompute long_url_hash (e.g., SHA-256).\nEnforce UNIQUE(user_id, long_url_hash).\nOn unique conflict, return the existing code instead of creating a new one.\n\nAdditional Complication Idea: Multi-Region Writes\n\nUse a global allocator (or globally unique ID scheme) so regions do not generate colliding codes.\nReplicate code -&gt; long_url mappings across regions asynchronously for low-latency local reads.\nGlobal uniqueness does not imply instant cross-region visibility, so keep read-after-write mitigation (regional stickiness or origin fallback).\n\nAdditional Complication Idea: Abuse Handling\n\nValidate/normalize URL input and enforce domain/IP/user rate limits on create APIs.\nRun safe-browsing/phishing checks and maintain allow/block lists.\nKeep link status (active, under_review, blocked) and enforce status checks during redirect.\n\nAdditional Complication Idea: Analytics Pipeline\n\nRedirect path should stay fast: emit click events asynchronously (queue/log) and return immediately.\nEnrich events offline/streaming (geo/device/referrer) and filter bots before aggregation.\nStore raw events with retention policy and expose product metrics from aggregated stores.\n\nAdditional Complication Idea: Hot Key Protection\n\nCache hot links aggressively at CDN/edge and application cache layers.\nUse single-flight/request coalescing + stale-while-revalidate to prevent cache stampedes.\nAdd per-key throttling/circuit breakers so viral links do not overload the origin store.\n\nAdditional Complication Idea: Custom Aliases (Paid Business Tier)\n\nUniqueness and race conditions: treat alias as code, enforce UNIQUE(code), return 409 alias_taken on conflict.\nPlan gating and quotas: only paid tenants can use custom aliases, with per-tenant limits and create/update rate limits.\nBrand safety and abuse: maintain reserved keywords, run profanity/phishing checks, and allow moderation flags.\nLifecycle policy: keep aliases immutable by default and use tombstones (e.g., 60-90 days) before reuse.\nNamespace model: choose global alias uniqueness or tenant-scoped uniqueness (UNIQUE(tenant_id, code)) with branded domains.\n\nAdditional Complication Idea: Encryption, Deletion + Expiration, GDPR\n\nEncryption: encrypt long_url at rest (KMS-managed keys), TLS in transit, and restrict key access by service role.\nSoft delete vs hard delete: soft delete marks inactive immediately (deleted_at) so redirects stop fast; hard delete asynchronously purges data from DB, caches, replicas, and analytics stores.\nExpiration: use expires_at; expired links return a terminal response (commonly 410) and trigger cache invalidation/tombstone flow.\nGDPR: maintain a deletion workflow with audit trail and SLA (for example, complete hard-delete propagation within policy window).\nReuse safety: keep minimal tombstones before code/alias reuse to prevent link hijacking after delete/expire.\n\nSample Interface (Python)\nimport random\nimport string\n\nBASE62 = string.digits + string.ascii_lowercase + string.ascii_uppercase\n\n\nclass TinyUrlService:\n    def __init__(self, repository):\n        self.repository = repository\n\n    def _random_code(self, size=6):\n        return \"\".join(random.choice(BASE62) for _ in range(size))\n\n    def create_short_url(self, long_url: str) -&gt;
