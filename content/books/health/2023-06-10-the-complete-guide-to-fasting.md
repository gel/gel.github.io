This book had a strong personal impact on me.

As someone who never fasted before, even on Yom Kippur, it made me realize what I had been missing for many years in my life.

Together with [The Cancer Code](/books/health/2023-05-20-the-cancer-code/), it changed how I think about health routines, sugar intake, recovery, and long-term quality of life.
