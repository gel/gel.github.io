I was never fully into the keto concept, but this book made me think it has more practical value than I initially assumed.

In general, a lot of my perspective here was influenced by Jason Fung's work, especially [The Cancer Code](/books/health/2023-05-20-the-cancer-code/) and [The Complete Guide to Fasting](/books/health/2023-06-10-the-complete-guide-to-fasting/).

From that lens, keto also makes sense as another tool that can help with metabolic health.
