As someone with family history in this area, this book was very important to me.

Together with [The Complete Guide to Fasting](/books/health/2023-06-10-the-complete-guide-to-fasting/), it pushed me to make concrete lifestyle changes: cutting sugar significantly and rethinking my eating, sleep, and sports routine.

This had a huge positive influence on my quality of life.
