Jason Fung completely flipped my perspective on weight loss. Growing up with the wrong eating habits into an unhealthy childhood, I used to think it was just about willpower and "calories in, calories out." It's not.

Fung shows that obesity is a hormonal disorder, specifically driven by insulin. This book was a massive game changer for me—it changed my entire thinking about sugar and diabetes, and finally gave me a framework that makes sense of why traditional dieting fails for so many.
