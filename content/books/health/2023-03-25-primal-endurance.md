Mark Sisson’s approach to endurance was a massive unlock for my running. He breaks down why grinding through "chronic cardio" while fueling on sugar is a recipe for burnout. Instead, he teaches you how to build a real fat-burning engine.

The core lesson is keeping the food clean—unprocessed, high-quality fuel—to keep the engine running smoothly. Shifting my mindset from sugar-burning to fat-adapted performance has helped me tremendously during my runs, making the whole experience feel sustainable rather than a struggle.
