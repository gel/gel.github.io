This book felt too generic and repetitive for me.

It reads like a collection of common productivity tips, with a lot of anecdotes and not enough depth.

Good as a light checklist for beginners, but if you already have routines, it probably adds little value.

Best approach is to take 1-2 ideas selectively and ignore the one-size-fits-all framing.
