Very strong principles and a strong framework.

What I like most is how it helps with planning and becoming more conscious of daily decisions instead of running on autopilot.

A practical example for me was gaming: once I looked at it through this framework, it became easier to classify it as mostly negative for my goals and time allocation.

I recommend this book to everyone. It is one of the few books I believe is useful on a daily basis.
