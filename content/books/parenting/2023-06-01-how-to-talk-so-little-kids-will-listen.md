This one was a bit too long for my taste.

That said, it has many practical communication tricks that really help.

Some examples I found useful:

- Present only two options instead of open-ended negotiation.
- Acknowledge feelings first, then set boundaries.
- Turn commands into playful challenges when possible.
- Use short, clear language instead of long explanations during conflict.
