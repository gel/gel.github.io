Haidt makes a compelling case about the dangers of unrestricted smartphone and social media access for children, backed by clear research on youth mental health trends since 2010. While the book effectively demonstrates how digital technology is impacting childhood development and offers practical solutions (like delaying smartphone access until age 16), it could be more concise. The research is valuable for parents and educators, but the density might deter some readers from absorbing the core message.
Key takeaway: Smartphones and social media are significantly harming youth mental health - we need to act now to protect our kids.

As a dad, this book also left a big personal mark on me.

It made me revisit many of my misguided assumptions as a tech-savvy parent. The examples were excellent and practical.

I will absolutely fight for my kids' mental health and do my best to help them succeed in the modern world without unnecessary social anxiety.
