Sapiens feels like a strong argument for optimism about humanity and the long-term direction of the world.

When I first read it, it gave me a real mental boost.

Today, based on what I see globally, I disagree with parts of that optimism. It seems to me that some of the narrative is less grounded in reality than it initially appeared.

I still think it is worth reading because it is thought-provoking and broad, but I would read it critically.
