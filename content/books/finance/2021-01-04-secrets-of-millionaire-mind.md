This book changed my mindset in a few important ways.

One idea that strongly resonated with me was learning to accept gifts and support instead of automatically rejecting them. Looking back, I can see how often I made that mistake.

I also liked the focus on mindset shifts and intentionally spending time with people who share a growth and abundance-oriented perspective.

I do disagree with some of the premises. Environment, education, and early habits have a huge impact, and those habits are not easy to change just by deciding to think differently.

Overall, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants a different perspective on wealth and becoming rich.
