This is one of the iconic finance books that almost everyone gets recommended at some point.

At the same time, I think it should be read with a critical mindset and a grain of salt. Similar to other popular authors in this space, there is controversy around the person behind the book.

Even if you treat it partly like a fiction-style narrative, it still offers useful thought frameworks: asymmetric salary growth, ownership, and the importance of building and innovating instead of relying only on linear income.

I would still recommend reading it, but as a mindset starter, not as a strict blueprint.
