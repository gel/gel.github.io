## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, return the **longest palindromic substring** in `s`.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consist of only digits and English letters.

### Follow-up

Can you solve it in O(n²) time? What about O(n) time using Manacher's algorithm?
