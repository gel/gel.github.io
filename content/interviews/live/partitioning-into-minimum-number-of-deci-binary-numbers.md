## Problem Description

A decimal number is called **deci-binary** if each of its digits is either `0` or `1` without any leading zeros. For example, `101` and `1100` are deci-binary, while `112` and `3001` are not.

Given a string `n` that represents a positive decimal integer, return *the **minimum** number of positive deci-binary numbers needed so that they sum up to* `n`.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = "32"
Output: 3
Explanation: 10 + 11 + 11 = 32
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = "82734"
Output: 8
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = "27346209830709182346"
Output: 9
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n.length <= 10^5`
- `n` consists of only digits.
- `n` does not contain any leading zeros and represents a positive integer.
