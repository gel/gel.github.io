This podcast was amazing!

My thinking about DHH is that he is a pioneer of the next revolutions - particularly around self-hosting, cost-savings, and flat-pricing models. He shares a similar enthusiasm for education, innovation, and being tech-savvy that really resonates with me.

The conversation covers a wide range of topics from the future of programming and AI to practical discussions about productivity and parenting. DHH's perspectives on building sustainable businesses, challenging industry norms, and maintaining a balanced approach to technology and life make this a must-listen episode.
