Generative AI is changing how we build software and create content. From coding assistants to image generation, these tools are practical utilities that are becoming standard in our workflows.

Large Language Models, a subset of generative AI, are particularly fascinating. They have the ability to understand and generate human language with remarkable proficiency. As we explore the inner workings of LLMs, we will encounter systems like Antrophic Claude, GPT-4, BERT, and their successors, which continue to push the limits of what machines can achieve with words.

In this book, I will look at the technical foundations of these AI systems, their philosophical and ethical considerations, their potential applications, and the challenges they pose. By combining thorough research with accessible explanations, my goal is to make this complex subject matter engaging for both AI aficionados and newcomers alike.
