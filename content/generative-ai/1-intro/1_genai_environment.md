## 🔌 Recommended MCP Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers extend your AI agents with external capabilities. A key benefit: **same MCP config works across all environments**. You can switch agents/editors without reconfiguring.

| MCP Server | Purpose | Link |
|------------|---------|------|
| **Perplexity Search** | Web research with citations (Perplexity PRO provides high-quality search value) | [perplexity-mcp](https://github.com/perplexityai/modelcontextprotocol) |
| **mobile-next/mobile-mcp** | iOS/Android device automation | [mobile-mcp](https://github.com/mobile-next/mobile-mcp) |
| **telegram-mcp** | Telegram bot integration | [telegram-mcp](https://github.com/dryeab/mcp-telegram) |

## My Personal Setup

I choose tools based on **ROI** and continuously compare across options. Key principle: don't get locked into one tool. Keep evaluating as the space evolves rapidly.
