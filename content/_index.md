## Senior Architect & Engineer

I am a **Senior Software Engineer & Enterprise Solution Architect** at **AWS**, formerly a Software Architect at **Intel**. My expertise lies in the transition from "Metal to Cloud"—optimizing everything from silicon instruction sets to hyperscale distributed systems.

Currently, I lead the development of **Production-Grade Agentic AI**, focusing on observability, cost-efficiency, and "trustworthy" autonomous systems for Fortune 100 enterprises.
